      <p class="right-card"><img src="" alt="" class=self> I am very excited to show you about myself and my work.
        The process of coding has become something I enjoy more than I thought I would.
        I was introduced to computers at a young age and immediately was facinated.
        I somehow managed to get my hands on a Commodore 64 and spent countless hours trying to figure out dos commands
        and make my own programs.
        But life is never a straight line. I went to work in retail at age 20 and just never left.
        I love working with a team and helping others to progress. I had the opportunity to travel for work which
        allowed me to work with a diverse range of people.
        Some 22 years later, and with a bit of relief, I decided it was time and left the company.
        I joined the KU Full-stack Bootcamp, and although the experience was tough, it was awesome.
        I’ve learned just how much I enjoy the process and the challenges of coding.
